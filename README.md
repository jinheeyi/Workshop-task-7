## Intro
- I successfully completed nearly all tasks for 'Workshop Week 1 and 2,' gaining experience in creating animations, working with text and language, and incorporating interactive elements like recording graphs and textboxes. Next is working on with stimulation, realizing there's many options on stimulation for example; gravity, water(fluid) and train etc. I decided to make a ball stimulation, mainly focusing on moving ball physics and the gravity on how the ball plunges or directions. And additionally, changing the colour, including the background. Checking on www.google.com, to get examples of the ball simulation and there was some good examples from p5.js.

## Notes (working progress)

- From the workshop, it indicates on how the ball was moving and how the gravity interacts with two balls. 

```ruby
constructor(x, y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y; 
    this.color = color(random(255), random(255), random(255)); // random color
  }
```
- this is for colour changing, but somehow the colour changes if I restart the sketch window. So I further looked into www.google.com, 'changing colour p5js' and saw one of the examples that I was looking for.

(this is where through clicking, the colour automatically changes into various colours.)
