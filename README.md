## Intro
- I successfully completed nearly all tasks for 'Workshop Week 1 and 2,' gaining experience in creating animations, working with text and language, and incorporating interactive elements like recording graphs and textboxes. Next is working on with stimulation, realizing there's many options on stimulation for example; gravity, water and train etc. I decided to make a water stimulation, mainly focusing on water physics and the gravity on how the water plunges or goes down.
